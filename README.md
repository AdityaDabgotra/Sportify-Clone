Spotify Clone (Frontend Only)
This is a Spotify clone created using React and React Router. This project mimics the basic functionality of Spotify, including a music library, song player, and user-friendly navigation. The app is entirely frontend-based, making use of React components and React Router for navigation. For music data, we simulate content or you can integrate with a mock API or Spotify Web API.

Features
Homepage: Displays featured playlists and artists.
Music Player: Basic audio player controls to play/pause songs, skip tracks, and view the current song playing.
Search Functionality: Users can search for songs, artists, or playlists (integrates with a mock API or static data).
Navigation: Simple routing using React Router to navigate between Home, Search, and Playlist pages.
Responsive Design: Mobile and desktop-friendly interface.
Technologies Used
React (for building the user interface)
React Router (for client-side routing)
CSS/SCSS (for styling)
Axios (Optional, if fetching mock data or external API data)
